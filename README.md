# Round Robin CPU Scheduler — Discrete Event Simulation

A full Round Robin CPU scheduling simulation built with:
- Min-heap priority queues
- Linked lists for Ready/I/O queues
- A complete PCB (Process Control Block)
- A 5-state FSM: New, Ready, Running, Blocked, Exit

## 🔥 Features
- Preemption & context switching
- I/O and CPU burst modeling
- Time quantum experimentation
- Tracking CPU utilization, turnaround time, and wait time

## 🛠️ Tech Used
C++, data structures, discrete-event simulation
